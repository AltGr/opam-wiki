# Installing OPAM

This tutorial is a complement to the [Quick Install](Quick_Install.html)
tutorial and provides complements on how to install OPAM directly from
sources. This is *not* the recommended way of installing OPAM.

## Installing OPAM from source

### Prerequisites:

* ocaml (at least 3.12.1)
* curl or wget
* git (optional, to use the git backend)
* rsync (optional, to use the rsync backend)

### Obtaining OPAM

Download the latest stable version of OPAM [here](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam/archive/latest.tar.gz).

If you want to try the development (unstable) version of OPAM, clone
 the git repository: `git clone
 git://github.com/OCamlPro/opam.git`. Please keep in mind that this
 version may not work as expected.

### Compiling OPAM

To compile opam (binaries will be installed in `/usr/local/bin`),
simply run:

```
./configure
make
```

To have OPAM installed in a specific location, please do

```
./configure --prefix=/the/opam/path
make
```

This will fetch the necessary archives if they are not already
downloaded and then build OPAM. If you just want to get the necessary
dependencies without compiling the project, run `make clone`.

#### BSD systems

On *BSD systems, you need to use `gmake` instead of `make`. Moreover, the
default path for installing the manual pages needs to be changed:

```
./configure --mandir /usr/local/man
gmake
```

### Installing OPAM

To install opam simply run:

```
sudo make install
```

OPAM will be installed under `$prefix`, that is under `/usr/local` if
you did not specify a prefix in the configure phase, or whatever
location you specified.

# Initializing OPAM

Before using OPAM, you need to initialize its state. Start by doing:

```
opam init
eval `opam config env`
```

This will:

* Create OPAM configuration files in `~/.opam`

* Add the default remote repository at URL `http://opam.ocamlpro.com`
  using opamâ€™s HTTP repository backend.

* Update your local environment to be able to use OPAM packages and compilers.

It is recommanded that you add ``eval `opam config env` `` in the
configuration file of your shell (most likely `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.profile`).

To learn more about these two commands, try `opam init --help` and
`opam config --help`.

### Uninstalling OPAM

To uninstall OPAM, simply run:

```
$ make uninstall
```

at the root of the sources. Or you can simply remove OPAM binaries, manual pages and state:

```
$ rm -rf $(opam config var root)
$ rm -f  $(which opam) $(which opam-admin)
```
